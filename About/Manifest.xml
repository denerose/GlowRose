    <!--  Soapbox Speech:
          Using date of release as version number communicates more useful information 
          than the v1.1.001 style version numbering, and dispenses with the waste of time that is
          assessing the largely subjective importance of an update.
          For multiple releases during the same day, append another digit: 2021.3.27.1
      -->
